To predict heart disease at early stages.
The study leverages clinical data and evaluates the models based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score using a test set.
This investigation explores the efficacy of five classification models—Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)—for predicting heart attacks. 
The research highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting heart attacks, providing insights into their role in early diagnosis and preventive measures.
